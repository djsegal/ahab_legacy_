My guide to looking at this would be to start in either 'seagull' or 'parameterSweep' and work your way down.

  Seagull was designed for running on one computer (and actually works)
  
  Parameter Sweep is designed to run on a network of computers (and has since feel into disrepair due to updates elsewhere)
  
Then, work your way down.  All the files after the above ones are inside the "red" folder.
